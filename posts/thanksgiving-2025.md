Description: Thanks for giving!

Dear sponsors,

As we approach Thanksgiving once again, I’m reminded that sustained open source software development, supported by long term sponsors, is not something to take for granted.

I’m genuinely grateful for your ongoing support through GitHub Sponsors. Your contributions make a real difference: my Clojure projects wouldn’t be nearly as polished, maintained, or ambitious without your help.

If you’d like to look back on what happened in open source this past year, you can find an overview here: https://blog.michielborkent.nl/tags/oss-updates.html. The core projects remain clj-kondo, babashka, SCI, scittle, and squint/cherry. Each of them continues to grow in capability and adoption.

I’ve also applied for Clojurists Together again for 2026. If you’re a CT sponsor, a vote in the next long-term funding round would be appreciated.

Here are the main ideas I want to explore in 2026:

- Clj-kondo: run macros directly from source code
- Clj-kondo: run exported configs/hooks directly from classpath (instead of having to copy files to a local dir)
- Squint/Cherry: browser nREPL support
- Squint/Cherry: source maps
- Squint: protocolize coll functions so you can extend them to e.g. ImmutableJS or other custom collections
- Scittle2 (working name): better/faster/smaller version of Scittle using Cherry (in-browser CLJS compiler)
- Babashka: support CIDER middleware from source directly in bb
- Babashka: distinguished parallel task output (e.g. colors or prefix)
- Clj-kondo: add first-class support for Clojure dialects like ClojureDart and Jank
- Clojure CLI: help improve UX via a new tools working group
- Clj-kondo: performance improvements for bigger projects

I can't make any promises on hard deadlines, but I definitely intend to work toward realizing the above goals.

Aside from software development, I'm also organizing Babashka Conf 2026 the day before Dutch Clojure Days.

As always, feel free to reach out anytime, whether here, on Clojurians Slack, or by email at michielborkent@gmail.com. I love hearing about what you are doing with my projects. Also if you are struggling with something, let me know. Your feedback and use cases continue to shape the direction of my work.

Here’s to another strong year of Clojure OSS!

Thank you for making this journey possible.

With appreciation,

Michiel Borkent / @borkdude
