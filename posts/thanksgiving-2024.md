Description: Thanks for giving!

Dear sponsors,

It's almost Thanksgiving again. We don't have this tradition here in The
Netherlands, but I do think it's a good to have a special day to count our
blessings. I feel very blessed because of your ongoing support. My Clojure
projects wouldn't be as well maintained and fully featured if I didn't have the
sponsoring that I have currently.

You can read about the past year of OSS updates (and further back)
[here](https://blog.michielborkent.nl/tags/oss-updates.html). Main projects are
still clj-kondo, babashka, SCI, scittle, squint.

You can read about my plans for the next year
[here](https://www.clojuriststogether.org/news/vote-on-2025-long-term-funding-applications/#michiel-borkent)
(a vote would be appreciated as well if you happen to be a CT sponsor!).

Feel free to reach out if you want to contact me about anything. Here, on
Clojurians Slack, e-mail (michielborkent@gmail.com) or otherwise. I'd love to
chat and catch up with you about how you are using (some of) my projects.

Here's to another year of Clojure OSS! Thanks for your support!

With gratitude,

Michiel Borkent / @borkdude
