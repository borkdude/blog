## Updates

Autumn is upon us.



<img src="assets/dutch-clojure-meetup-october-2025.jpg" width="50%" align="center">

One of the big things Iâ€™m looking forward to is speaking at [Clojure Conj 2025](https://www.2025.clojure-conj.org/schedule).

- eucalypt
- reagami
- edamame clojureCLR support
- SCI clojureCLR support

- [Cljdoc](https://github.com/cljdoc/cljdoc/blob/488fe6282737c1237c5394a66a7e8392a000c6bb/doc/cljdoc-developer-technical-guide.adoc#front-end-code) chose squint for its small bundle sizes and easy migration off of TypeScript towards CLJS
