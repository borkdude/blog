Description: My Clojure OSS updates for September and October 2025

## Updates

The summer heat has faded, and autumn is upon us. One big focus for me is
preparing my talk for [Clojure Conj
2025](https://www.2025.clojure-conj.org/schedule), titled "Making tools
developers actually use". I did a test run of the talk at the Dutch Clojure
Meetup. It went a bit too long at 45 minutes, so I have to shrink it almost by
half for the Conj. The more I work on the talk the more ideas come up, so it's
challenging!

Of course I spent a ton of time on OSS the past two months as well.
Some special mentions:

- I'm pretty excited by [Eucalypt](https://github.com/chr15m/eucalypt), a remake
  of [Reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent) for
  [Squint](https://github.com/squint-cljs/squint) without React by Chris
  McCormick. It lets you build UIs with the Reagent API in less than 10kb of
  gzip'ed JS. The code was initially generated by an LLM, but now work is going
  into making the code base thoroughly tested and simplified where possible.
- After studying Eucalypt's code I figured that making an even more minimal
  Reagent-like by hand would be fun. This is where I came up with
  [Reagami](https://github.com/borkdude/reagami). The API looks like a hybrid
  between Reagent and [Replicant](https://replicant.fun/). You can build apps with Reagami starting around 5kb gzip'ed.
- [Edamame](https://github.com/borkdude/edamame) got [Clojure CLR](https://github.com/clojure/clojure-clr) support thanks to Ambrose Bonnaire-Sergeant.
- [SCI](https://github.com/babashka/sci) Clojure CLR support is underway. The `sci.impl.Reflector` code, based on `clojure.lang.Reflector` was ported to Clojure with the purpose that it would then be easier to translate to Clojure CLR.
- [Cljdoc](https://github.com/cljdoc/cljdoc/blob/488fe6282737c1237c5394a66a7e8392a000c6bb/doc/cljdoc-developer-technical-guide.adoc#front-end-code) chose squint for its small bundle sizes and easy migration off of TypeScript towards CLJS
- Via work on Squint, I found a way to optimize `str` in ClojureScript (worst case 4x, best case 200x)

Here are updates about the projects/libraries I've worked on in the last two months in detail.
