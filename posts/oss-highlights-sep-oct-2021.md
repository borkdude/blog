Title: OSS Highlights of September - October 2021
Date: 2021-11-03
Tags: clojure, oss updates

This year I'm receiving a long term grant from [Clojurists
Together](https://www.clojuriststogether.org/). CT asked me to do a bimonthly
report on my activities or write a blog post and link to that. That's what I'm
doing here. I'll be going over the releases of existing and new projects and
will mention highlights in some of them. Often, the devil is in the details and
there aren't any new user-facing features, but still a lot of work has gone into
refining existing features.

Donations from [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/borkdude),
OpenCollective and the year long CT grant directly allow me to spend more time
on open source. The list you are seeing here is a result of this. I love working
on open source so thank you for allowing me to do this. In
[this](https://soundcloud.com/user-959992602/s4-e40-oss-with-michiel-borkent)
[ClojureScript podcast](https://clojurescriptpodcast.com/) episode, Jacek Schae
interviewed me on my decision to quit my previous job and work more on Clojure
OSS. Have a listen if you want to know more about my motivations. If aside from
sponsoring, you or your company needs work done on any of these or related
projects and want to make a custom arrangement, please do reach out.

Note that the projects listed below are not exclusively my effort and are worked
on by a number or regular contributors. My thanks also goes out to them.

# [Nbb](https://github.com/babashka/nbb)

Ad-hoc CLJS scripting on Node.js using SCI.

Many releases on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nbb).

Highlights:

- Console REPL. If you have Node.js simply type `npx nbb` and you will be dropped into a REPL.
- Socket server REPL
- nREPL server for development with Calva
- Add `clojure.test` so you can now use nbb to develop e.g. browser tests using puppeteer or playwright
- Support for reader conditionals using `:org.babashka/nbb`
- Print nicer stacktrace when error happens (similar to bb)
- Misc. fixes and enhancements.
- Add `js-interop` module
- Add Javascript API

Many exciting things are happening around this project in the community. It's
now possible to run nbb on
[lambda](https://github.com/vharmain/nbb-lambda-adapter). [Exercism](https://github.com/babashka/nbb/discussions/91#discussioncomment-1510273) is using babashka and nbb to run Clojure exercise submissions. [Sitefox](https://github.com/chr15m/sitefox) is a CLJS + Node.js web framework that works well with nbb.

# [Clj-kondo](https://github.com/clj-kondo/clj-kondo)

A linter for Clojure (code) that sparks joy.

Releases: [2021.10.19](https://github.com/clj-kondo/clj-kondo/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#20211019)
, [2021.09.25](https://github.com/clj-kondo/clj-kondo/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#20210925)

, [2021.09.14](https://github.com/clj-kondo/clj-kondo/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#20210914)

Highlights:

- New linter: warn on missing `gen-class` when writing `-main` function. See [docs](https://github.com/clj-kondo/clj-kondo/blob/master/doc/linters.md#main-without-gen-class).
- New `loop` without `recur` linter. See [docs](https://github.com/clj-kondo/clj-kondo/blob/master/doc/linters.md#loop-without-recur).
- Several inference improvements, e.g. `(def f (fn [])) (f 1 2)` will now give
  an arity warning.
- Return arbitrary metadata in analysis data. See [docs](https://github.com/clj-kondo/clj-kondo/blob/master/analysis/README.md).
